# homebrewlife
A suite of apps for your homebrewing ease

Buying ingredients is fun. Spending too much money is not. Using a beerxml file (most likely exported from beersmith) for recipes, a price list from your favorite retailer on ingredients (and various sizes available), and a list of the recipes from the beerxml file you want to buy for:

```bash
homebrewlife --beerxml=recipes.xml --pricedb=pricelist.json --recipelist=recipelist.json

1lb of Caramel/Crystal Malt - 20L x 1 (1.69)
